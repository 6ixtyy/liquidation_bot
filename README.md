# Compound v2 Liquidation Bot

A sophisticated Solidity-based bot that demonstrates the historical price manipulation vulnerability in Compound v2 during DeFi Summer 2020.

##  Overview

This project replicates the historical exploit where a liquidator gained an edge by manipulating the Open Price Feed in Compound v2. The bot demonstrates how stale but valid signed prices could be used to trigger liquidations before other market participants could react.

### Key Features

- Simulates price manipulation using stale-but-valid signed price data
- Executes `liquidateBorrow()` on undercollateralized accounts
- Built with Foundry for efficient testing and deployment
- Uses mainnet forking for realistic testing conditions
- Demonstrates the exact attack vector used on August 20, 2020
